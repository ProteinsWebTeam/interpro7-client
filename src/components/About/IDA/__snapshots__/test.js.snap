        InterPro Domain Architecture

      The InterPro Domain Architecture (IDA) tool allows you to search the InterPro database with a particular set of domains, and returns all of the domain architectures and associated proteins that match the query.

        How are Domain architectures derived?

      <p>
        Domain architectures are derived from matches to Pfam Entries. The results will show all proteins matching the criteria selected below. You can select entries which must be included or excluded from your search results. Entries can be selected by either entering a Pfam accession, or an InterPro accession if a Pfam entry is integrated with it.
