      What is InterPro?
    </h4>
    <p>
      InterPro is a resource that provides functional analysis of protein sequences by classifying them into families and predicting the presence of domains and important sites. To classify proteins in this way, InterPro uses predictive models, known as signatures, provided by several different databases (referred to as member databases) that make up the InterPro consortium.

      What is InterProScan?
    </h4>
    <p>
      InterProScan is the software package that allows sequences to be scanned against InterPro's signatures (more information about

    <h4>
      Why is InterPro useful?
    </h4>
    <p>
      InterPro combines signatures from multiple, diverse databases into a single searchable resource, reducing redundancy and helping users interpret their sequence analysis results. By uniting the member databases, InterPro capitalises on their individual strengths, producing a powerful diagnostic tool and integrated resource.

    <h4>
      Who uses InterPro?
    </h4>
    <p>
      InterPro is used by research scientists interested in the large-scale analysis of whole proteomes, genomes and metagenomes, as well as researchers seeking to characterise individual protein sequences. Within the EMBL-EBI, InterPro is used to help annotate protein sequences in UniProtKB. It is also used by the Gene Ontology Annotation group to automatically assign Gene Ontology terms to protein sequences.
